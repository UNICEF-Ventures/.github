Now, more than ever, innovation is critical to building a better world with and for children. We must do more collectively, we must act faster together, to design, use and scale truly transformational solutions for every child to thrive.
Whether itâ€™s augmented reality and drones, monitoring vaccinations in real time, or even harnessing satellites to secure access to lifegiving water, innovation drives progress for children.
